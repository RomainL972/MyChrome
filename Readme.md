# MyChrome
MyChrome is a web browser I'm creating, it is a quite little one but I want to use it as a training for learning programmation.

To build the sources you need :
-Qt 5.9.1
-C++ compiler

Run the following commands in the terminal to build :

qmake
make

qmake will generate the MakeFile and make will generate the objects, some additional .cpp files and the binary.
